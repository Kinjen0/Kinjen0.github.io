                <h1>Defenders Of The Great Tree!</h1>
                <p>So a bit about this project. This was one of the first real projects I ever worked on, and the first group programming project I was a part of. 
                    Before this, my work was limited to specific assignments, and almost completely solo. And for these i was directed to create programs with specific functions
                    and specific requirements, with almost everything laid out for me. This was the first time I was put in a group and given a blank slate and told to create something. 
                    We were given a few requirements, but for the most part, we were free to do as we wanted. 
                    We were given a few weeks to work on this project. And took a simple concept from the planning stage to completion. I learned a lot from this project, and one day hope to go back and improve it!</p>
