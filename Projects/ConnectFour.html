                    This project was the second of my real projects. It was solo, and was the first time I was given complete control over what I wanted to do. This was also when I was finally 
                    starting to understand Object Oriented Programming. I learned a great deal from this project. And I had to come up with an algorithm for the game on my own. 
                    Unfortunatly, I made this project before I was comfortable using github, so I dont have a repository for it. But I am working on trying to recover the code. And I hope to come back and build a
                    gui for the game, and make it really playable.
